 Added test to catch rare case in module ellipse, subroutine ell_ell_intersect

 detailed reflection.

 fix to a bug in RM effect in 1.4.3 and a bug in the flux-weighted radial
 velocity when using detailed reflection.

 Added module coords.f90

 Added GD448_rv.py to examples/GD448 to test RV+heating calculations.

 Added notes/figures on coordinate systems in subdirectory doc/.

 Fixed bug initialisation of vsini_2 value in lc.py and rv.py. This changes
 the output of examples/PhotRM/PhotRM.py

 Improved calculation of gravity in the exact_grav case - now done on the
 Roche equipotential at the same angular coordinate as the ellipsoid surface.

 Added option to use an improved calculation of ellipsoid size for Roche
 potential case so that volume of the Roche equipotential surface is constant
 in an eccentric orbit and is equal to the volume of a sphere with radius
 specified by the user. With the star model "roche", the volume is calculated
 either the volume of the approximating ellipsoid. For synchronous rotation
 only, the new star shape model "roche_v" uses equation (2.18) from Kopal
 "Dynamics of Close Binary Systems" (Springer, 1978) to calculate the volume
 enclosed by the equipotential surface. This makes very little difference
 unless the star is very distorted and is slower.
