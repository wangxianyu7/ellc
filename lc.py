      consistent with t_zero and period.

      Model used to calculate the shape of star 1 - see Notes.

  shape_2 : {"roche", "roche_v", "sphere", "poly1p5", "poly3p0", "love"}
      Model used to calculate the shape of star 2 - see Notes. 
      Default is "sphere".

  spots_1 : (4, n_spots_1) array_like

   are longitude, latitude, size and brightness factor. All three angles are
   in degrees.

   Parameters of the spots on star 2. For each spot the parameters, in order,
   are longitude, latitude, size and brightness factor. All three angles are
   in degrees.

  exact_grav : {True|False}
    Use point-by-point calculation of local surface gravity for calculation of
    gravity darkening is True, otherwise use (much faster) approximation based
    on functional form fit to local gravity at 4 points on the star.

  Returns
  -------
  flux : ndarray
      Flux in arbitrary units.

  Notes
  -----

   The asynchronous rotation factors rotfac_1 and rotfac_2 are used to
  calculate the shapes of the stars (unless spherical stars are specified).
  These rotation factors are relative to the actual synchronous rotation rate
  (rotation period = orbital period) not pseudo-synchronous rotation rate.

   The effect of the spot on the light curve is calculated using the
  algorithm by Eker [2] for circular spots on a spherical star with
  quadratic limb darkening. If the limb-darkening law used for the main
  calculation is not linear or quadratic then the coefficients of the
  limb-darkening law used for the calculation of the effects of the spots
  are set so that the intensity distribution matches at mu = 0, 0.5 and 1.

   N.B. The effect of each spot on the light curve is additive so overlapping
  spots can result in non-physical negative fluxes for some regions of the
  star.
 
   For the calculation of the star shape, the rotation and orbital angular
  momentum vectors are assumed parallel. The shape of each star is
  approximated by a triaxial ellipsoid with semi-major axes (A,B,C) and
  offset towards companion, D, from the centre-of-mass of the star towards
  the companion star. For the option "roche" the definition of the Roche
  potential from Wilson [3] is used and the values of A, B, C, D are set to
  that intersection points of the triaxial ellipsoid with x-, y- and z-axes
  lie on an equipotential surface. For the options "poly1p5" and "poly3p0"
  the star is assumed to behave as a polytrope with index n=1.5 or n=3,
  respectively. The tidal and rotational distortion of the polytrope are 
  assumed to be independent. The tidal distortion for polytropes is from
  Chandrasekhar [4] and the rotational distortion is calculated by
  interpolation in Table 1 of James [5]. For the option "love" the shape of
  the star is calculated using equation (10) and (11) from Correia [6] using
  the fluid second Love number for radial displacement, h_f (Correia equation
  (8)). The offset, D, is calculated using the approximation D=q.(R/d)^4,
  i.e., equation (38) from Chandrasekhar [4] with Delta_3=1 and nu = radius/d, 
  where d is the separation of the stars and q is the mass ratio.

    In eccentric orbits, the volume of the star is assumed to be constant. In
  general, the volume is calculated from the volume of the approximating
  ellipsoid. In the case of synchronous rotation, the volume of the star can
  be calculated using equation (2.18) from Kopal "Dynamics of Close Binary
  Systems" (Springer, 1978) by selecting the star shape model "roche_v".
   
   The simplified reflection model is approximately equivalent to Lambert
  law scattering with the coefficients heat_1 and heat_2  being equal to
  A_g/2, where A_g is the geometric albedo.

  Example
  -------
  >>> import ellc
  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  >>> t = np.arange(-0.25,0.75, 0.001)
  >>> spots_1 = [[30,180],[45,-45],[25,35],[0.2,0.8]]
  >>> flux = ellc.lc(t,radius_1=0.1,radius_2=0.05,sbratio=0.2,
  ...   incl=89.95,q=0.5,ld_1='quad',ldc_1=[0.65,0.2],ld_2='lin',ldc_2=0.45,
  ...   shape_1='poly3p0',shape_2='poly1p5',spots_1=spots_1)
  >>> plt.plot(t,flux)
  >>> plt.show()
